# Flight Advisor Service ![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/mohamed-taman/Flight-Advisor) [![Release Codename](https://img.shields.io/badge/codename-Advisor-yellow.svg)](https://github.com/mohamed-taman/Flight-Advisor/releases) [![BCH compliance](https://bettercodehub.com/edge/badge/mohamed-taman/Flight-Advisor?branch=main)](https://bettercodehub.com/) [![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/_tamanm?label=follow%20me&style=social)](https://twitter.com/_tamanm)Flight advisor Service is a set of APIs for primarily finding the cheapest flight from city A to city B based on price, returning all the trip information alongside the distance.## System Functionality- This project is developing a layered monolith **Spring Boot** based project (The latest version 2.  4.0), with an embedded database mode.- This project is an OAuth2 based project, using JWT token to secure endpoints. So you need to register first to continue using the system.- The functionality is reached based on user role, and there are three roles in the system.    - **Admin**: user is a predefined user (*admin@traveladvisor.com/Admin1234*).         - Admin needs to log-in first through `/login` API to get their token to contact the system.        - This user can upload airports and flight routes.        - Admin manages cities by adding, updating, or deleting them.        - Actually, the admin can do anything in the system.    -  **Client**: Clients should register first before using the system through `/register` public API.         -  After successful registration, they can then use the public `/login` API to get a token to contact the system successfully.        - Client can use all read API calls.        - Clients can add, manage their comments for a city, add, update, delete their comments, and see other comments.        - User can get the cheapest flight by calling `/cities/travel` API and provide airport codes for [from the city] and [to the city].    -  **Public**: it is not a role, but anonymous users use APIs under public.        - Use `/login` API call to log-in to the system, supplying the username and password. Then           you will           get a valid JWT token.        - Use `/register` API call to register as a client to use the system functionalities           related to the client, otherwise for he will receive *Not Authorized*.## Getting started### Project Management1. I have used GitHub projects to manage my tasks in the **Flight-Advisor** project. [Project Link](https://github.com/mohamed-taman/Flight-Advisor/projects/1).2. All MVP tasks are assigned to the **Flight Advisor API MVP** Milestone. [Milestone Link](https://github.com/mohamed-taman/Flight-Advisor/milestone/1?closed=1).3. I used pull requests to manages and close assigned tasks. [Tasks Link](https://github.com/mohamed-taman/Flight-Advisor/issues?q=is%3Aclosed).4. Finally, I have added releases to manage small features sprints until the final release v1.0. [Releases Link](https://github.com/mohamed-taman/Flight-Advisor/releases).5. Have a look at opened issues for future enhancements. [Opened Issues](https://github.com/mohamed-taman/Flight-Advisor/issues?q=is%3Aopen).### System components StructureLet's explain first the system layers structure to understand its components:```Flight-Advisor --> Parent folder. |- docs --> Contains system images.|- data --> Contains Airports and routes files.|- frontend --> Contains the frontend UI project.|- src/main/java - org.siriusxi.htec.fa (package)   |- FlightAdvisorApplication.java --> The main starting point of the application.  |- api --> Contains All REST API controllers that receive requests from the client,             to process that request, and finally, return appropriate responses.  |- repository --> All the database entities CRUD management services.   |- domain --> Domain contains all the database modeled entities,                 all request and response DTOs, as well as the mappers.  |- infra --> Contains all the configurations, exceptions, security management,                and support utilities to the system.   |- service --> Contains all the system business login,                  receives calls from Controllers, call repository to retrieve and manage data,                  then process them to return them to Controllers. ```Now, as we have learned about different system layers and components, so it is the time then to play, let's play.## Playing With Flight Advisor ServiceFirst things first, you need to download the following pieces of software to have fun with the project:### Required softwareThe following are the initially required software pieces:1. **Maven**: it can be downloaded from https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi#.2. **Git**: it can be downloaded from https://git-scm.com/downloads.3. **Java 15.0.1**: it can be downloaded from https://jdk.java.net/15/.4. **Node.js 15+**: Latest features, and it can be downloaded from https://nodejs.   org/en/download/current/.5. **Angular CLI**: Install it with the following command:    `npm install -g @angular/cli@latest`Follow the installation guide for each software, on provided website link and check your software versions from the command line to verify that they are all installed correctly.### Cloning ItNow it is the time to open **terminal** or **git bash** command line, and then clone the project under any of your favorite places with the following command:```bash> git clone https://github.com/mohamed-taman/Flight-Advisor.git```### Using an IDEI recommend that you work with your Java code using an IDE that supports the development of Spring Boot applications such as **Spring Tool Suite** or **IntelliJ IDEA Community | Ultimate Edition**. All you have to do is fire up your favorite IDE **->** open or import the parent folder `Flight-Advisor,` and everything will be ready for you.### Building & Running The SystemTo build and run Flight Advisor (FA) system components, run the following command:#### Building FA Components ##### FA backend```bash👻 [mtaman]:Flight-Advisor ~~ ./mvnw clean package```Now you should expect output like this:```JavaScript[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0[INFO] [INFO] [INFO] --- maven-jar-plugin:3.2.0:jar (default-jar) @ flight-advisor ---[INFO] Building jar: /Flight-Advisor/target/flight-advisor-1.0.jar[INFO] [INFO] --- spring-boot-maven-plugin:2.4.0:repackage (repackage) @ flight-advisor ---[INFO] Replacing main artifact with repackaged archive[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------[INFO] Total time:  14.620 s[INFO] Finished at: 2020-12-15T13:40:50+01:00[INFO] -----------------------------------------------------------------------```##### FA frontend```bash👻 [mtaman]:Flight-Advisor ~~ cd frontend👻 [mtaman]:frontend ~~ npm istall && ng build```Now you should expect output like this:```JavaScriptremoved 1 package and audited 1521 packages in 6.658s85 packages are looking for funding    run `npm fund` for details    found 6 vulnerabilities (3 low, 1 moderate, 1 high, 1 critical)    run `npm audit fix` to fix them, or `npm audit` for details    ✔ Browser application bundle generation complete.    ✔ Copying assets complete.    ✔ Index html generation complete.    Initial Chunk Files | Names         |      Sizevendor.js           | vendor        |   4.37 MBscripts.js          | scripts       | 153.22 kBpolyfills.js        | polyfills     | 149.77 kBstyles.css          | styles        | 142.28 kBmain.js             | main          |  13.32 kBruntime.js          | runtime       |   6.15 kB                        | Initial Total |   4.83 MBBuild at: 2020-12-20T18:30:00.555Z - Hash: ccf039ad034c30696fdb - Time: 8608ms```#### Running the SystemNow it's the time to run the system, and it's straightforward, just hit the following commands:##### FA backend```bash👻 [mtaman]:Flight-Advisor ~~ java --enable-preview -jar ./target/*.jar \ 👻 [mtaman]:Flight-Advisor ~+ --spring.profiles.active=prod```Or```bash 👻 [mtaman]:Flight-Advisor ~~ ./mvnw spring-boot:run \ 👻 [mtaman]:Flight-Advisor ~+ -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="--enable-preview" \ 👻 [mtaman]:Flight-Advisor ~+ -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="--spring.profiles.active=prod"```**Flight Advisor backend service** will run, with embedded H2 **database** that will be created under `db` folder and then the `flightDB.mv.db` file, and you should expect an output like this:```javascript2020-12-15 13:56:16.587  INFO 2981 --- [  restartedMain] o.s.b.a.h2.H2ConsoleAutoConfiguration: H2 console available at '/db-console'. Database available at 'jdbc:h2:./db/flightDB'2020-12-15 13:56:18.081  INFO 2981 --- [  restartedMain] o.s.b.w.embedded.tomcat.TomcatWebServer: Tomcat started on port(s): 8090 (http) with context path '/flight/service/api'2020-12-15 13:56:18.581  INFO 2981 --- [  restartedMain] o.s.h.f.F.AppStartupRunner: Congratulations, Flight Advisor Application, is Up & Running :)```##### FA frontend```bash👻 [mtaman]:frontend ~~ npm start```**Flight Advisor UI** will run, and you should expect an output like this:```javascript** Angular Live Development Server is listening on localhost:4200,    open your browser on http://localhost:4200/ **✔ Compiled successfully.```### Access Flight Advisor System APIsYou can play and test `Flight Advisor` APIs throughout its **OpenAPI** interface. 1. Go to the landing page at the following URL [http://localhost:8090/flight/service/api/](http://localhost:8090/flight/service/api/).2. Follow the link on the page, and you should see the following:![System APIs](docs/images/SystemAPI.png)3. More beautifully with its UI at [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/), and you    expect this view:   <!-- FIXME Add the system ui picture -->   ![System APIs](docs/images/SystemUI.png)#### System Behaviour1. First, if you want to upload airports or routes (in the data folder) using the **Files upload Management** section:      1. You need to log-in with the provided admin username/password to the `public/login` endpoint.     2. On a successful login, the response will contain an authorization token; copy it.     3. Click on the Authorize button and past it in the only field out there, `value,` then click the `Authorize` button.     4. Now, all locks are closed, and you can use the secured APIs.2. If you are a new client and want to access the system, you need first to register through the `/public/register` endpoint. Then follow previous point **1.1**.3. When uploading the Airports file, countries and cities will be created automatically.4. All search parameters are case-insensitive, and the system use like search by default.5. To add a city, you need a country, so from the **country management** section, you can search for the country you want.6. To manage comments, you need a city, so from the **city management** section, you can get all cities or search for a specific city.7. You can search for all airports for a specific city to know their codes, so you can use travel service.8. Use travel service to search for the cheapest flight from city to city, for example traveling from **CAI** (*Cairo International Airport, Egypt*) to **LAX** (*Los Angeles, USA*) the following results will be returned:```JSON[  {    "start": {      "airport": "Cairo International Airport",      "city": "Cairo",      "country": "Egypt",      "iata": "CAI"    },    "through": [      {        "airport": "Lester B. Pearson International Airport",        "city": "Toronto",        "country": "Canada",        "iata": "YYZ"      }    ],    "end": {      "airport": "Los Angeles International Airport",      "city": "Los Angeles",      "country": "United States",      "iata": "LAX"    },    "price": {      "total": 62.17,      "currency": "US"    },    "distance": {      "total": 12722.2,      "in": "KM"    }  }]```### Access Flight Advisor System DatabaseYou can access database through it online console from the following URL [http://localhost:8090/flight/service/api/db-console/](http://localhost:8090/flight/service/api/db-console/) with the following properties:- Driver class: `org.h2.Driver`- JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:./db/flightDB`- user: `sa`- password: `Admin1234`![System DB](docs/images/SystemDB.png)Hit test, and it should show a green bar for successful settings. So hit the **Connect** button and explore all data.### Stopping The SystemJust press the `CTRL+C` keys on the terminal.### Closing The StoryFinally, I hope you enjoyed the application and find it useful. If you would like to enhance, please open **PR**, and yet give it a 🌟.## The EndHappy Coding 😊 ## LicenseCopyright (C) 2020 Mohamed Taman, Licensed under the **MIT License**.
